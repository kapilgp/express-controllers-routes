# express-controllers-routes
Bind all Controllers and actions according to prefix routing. So we can manage multiple routing easily according to role basis.

We can setup multiple routing based on prefixes and controllers directory. Like: 

For admin: /admin/users

For general Users: /users

For managers: /managers/users
